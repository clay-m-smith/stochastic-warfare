# Remediation Backlog

This is the auditable source of truth for implementation gaps surfaced after the
Phase 104 review. Historical phase status remains unchanged; closing an item
here requires new production-path evidence.

Audit baseline: 2026-07-28 at `68acd4b`

## Evidence legend

- `D`: declared in a typed schema or interface
- `L`: loaded into the production runtime
- `W`: wired into the production execution path
- `E`: enabled and disabled behavior verified
- `X`: exercised under realistic production-path preconditions
- `O`: shown to change an observable outcome
- `P`: persisted or exposed through every required boundary

`-` means not yet proven. `N/A` requires a written reason in the issue record.

## REM-001 - Exact checkpoint restoration

### Requirements

- A checkpoint must capture and restore every unit's concrete class, side,
  ordering, and mutable entity state.
- Restore morale as `MoraleState` values, not untyped integers.
- Restore each weapon instance's ammunition, maintenance-round count, equipment
  condition, and fire cooldown, plus sensor runtime condition.
- Reuse existing unit, crew, and equipment objects when stable IDs and concrete
  types match so live weapon, sensor, and engine references remain valid.
- Reconstruct checkpoint units missing from a fresh runtime without consuming
  an RNG stream.
- Remove runtime-only units that are absent from the checkpoint.
- Reject duplicate entity IDs, unknown unit-class discriminators, and malformed
  morale values before committing a partial force/morale restore.
- Reject a different effective scenario configuration or incompatible
  weapon/sensor topology before mutating context-owned runtime state.
- A legacy checkpoint without unit/morale sections must leave the runtime roster
  untouched. Legacy unit snapshots without a class discriminator must use
  deterministic field-based inference.
- Restoring and continuing must produce the same state as uninterrupted
  continuation from the same checkpoint.

### Non-goals

- This phase does not repair reinforcement registration or loadout assignment;
  those are REM-004 and REM-005.
- This phase does not invent serialization for subsystem fields whose own
  `get_state()` implementation omits mutable state. Such findings become
  separate backlog items.
- Checkpoint schema migration/version negotiation remains outside this phase.

### Production trace

`SimulationEngine.get_state()` delegates to `SimulationContext.get_state()`,
which writes units and morale. `SimulationEngine.set_state()` delegates back to
`SimulationContext.set_state()`, which currently restores neither.

### Failing proof

The initial behavioral suite produced 7 failures and 1 compatibility-control
pass. Adversarial review then proved weapon branches could diverge while their
serialized engine states still compared equal, because loadout runtime state was
absent.

### Verification

Initially closed by 19 Phase 105 behavioral tests covering exact entity, morale,
weapon/sensor, configuration, corruption, atomic-rejection, legacy, bytes,
continuation, and fully loaded production-scenario behavior. See
[`phase-105.md`](devlog/phase-105.md) for exact commands and broader results.

Reopened during the Codex skill-port forward test. A production-shaped
checkpoint with `unit_weapon_states={"u": []}` and
`unit_sensor_states={"u": []}` rejects reconstruction of checkpoint-only unit
`u` as an incompatible extra topology. The contract permits fresh
reconstruction for an empty loadout; only non-empty serialized loadouts require
compatible prebuilt runtime instances.

Reclosed on 2026-07-28 after the restore path accepted and exactly preserved
empty checkpoint loadout entries, ignored and pruned stale loadouts belonging
to non-reusable same-ID units, and continued rejecting non-empty reconstructed
weapon or sensor state before mutation. The final behavioral suite has 23
tests; the checkpoint-wide selection passed 108 tests with 1 skipped, and the
fresh default suite passed 10,168 tests. A repeated adversarial postmortem found
no remaining medium- or high-severity issue in the repair.

### Residual boundaries

- Restore requires the same repository/data-catalog revision. Checkpoints do not
  embed hashes of external unit, weapon, ammunition, sensor, or era definitions.
- Dynamic reinforcement loadout construction remains REM-004/REM-005.
- Aggregation constituent reconstruction remains REM-016.

## REM-002 - API overrides do not reach the loaded scenario

### Requirements

- `RunSubmitRequest.config_overrides` is a partial `CalibrationSchema` overlay,
  not an unrestricted top-level scenario patch.
- Normalize the scenario's existing calibration and the submitted partial
  overlay to the structured schema, recursively merge mappings, replace
  scalars/lists, and let submitted values win.
- Validate both the partial overlay and the complete effective
  `CampaignScenarioConfig` before committing a run row or scheduling work.
- Reject unknown, dead, malformed, or top-level scenario keys with HTTP 422.
- Pass one isolated effective configuration to `ScenarioLoader`, terrain/frame
  capture, victory setup, duration/tick calculations, and summary generation.
- Preserve the source YAML byte-for-byte. Concurrent runs must not share or
  mutate effective configuration state.
- An empty overlay must be behaviorally identical to omitting the field.
- Persist and expose the submitted overlay through run detail while ensuring
  the stored result belongs to that effective configuration.

### Production trace and failing proof

At the Phase 106 starting revision, `POST /api/runs` validated
`RunSubmitRequest`, resolved the scenario, called `RunManager.submit()`, created
a SQLite row, and scheduled `_execute_run()`. `_run_sync()` merged the request
into an in-memory root YAML mapping, then called `ScenarioLoader.load(path)`,
which reopened the unchanged file. Engine context, calibration, forces, and
battle behavior therefore ignored the request while API-side terrain, victory,
timing, and summary code could see a different unvalidated root mapping.

A same-seed production control using `test_campaign` and
`roe_level=WEAPONS_HOLD` produced the same 108 events as the baseline through
the current API execution path. Loading an otherwise identical effective YAML
produced zero engagement events and left all ten units active, proving the
parameter is wired when it actually reaches `ScenarioLoader`.

### Verification

Verified on 2026-07-28. A same-seed real API A/B produces engagements and disabled
units under the baseline and zero engagements with all ten units active under
`WEAPONS_HOLD`. Repeated effective configurations compare equal across every
stored result, event, snapshot, terrain, and frame payload; omitted, empty, and
explicit-default overlays also match.

Loader and API tests prove non-default nested sibling preservation, mapping
merge/list replacement, canonical-plus-legacy normalization, isolated
concurrent configs, canonical overlay exposure, and byte-identical source YAML.
Unknown, dead, wrong-namespace, coercible wrong-type, unsupported semantic, and
unknown-side inputs return 422 before a row or task exists.

The accepted `nearest` target-selection alias now reaches the real closest
selection branch. Three archived-baseline/current production scenario pairs
showed expected semantic changes with no evaluator diagnostics; see
[Phase 106](devlog/phase-106.md#determinism-and-scenario-evaluation). This is
contract evidence, not a historical-fidelity claim.

`Enabled` is N/A because this is immutable run input, not an optional subsystem.
Checkpoint persistence is N/A because the effective configuration is fixed
before context construction; SQLite/API persistence remains required.

## REM-003 - Background execution can outlive database ownership

### Requirements

- One FastAPI lifespan owns one initialized `Database` and one `RunManager`,
  using the exact settings supplied to `create_app()`.
- A 202 response means the durable `pending` row exists and the manager accepted
  responsibility for the task.
- The manager must stop accepting work when shutdown begins and shutdown must be
  idempotent.
- On normal or exceptional lifespan exit, signal every run and batch
  cooperatively, wait for the actual worker to stop, persist one terminal state,
  notify subscribers, clear bookkeeping, and only then close the database.
- Valid transitions are `pending -> running -> completed|failed|cancelled` and
  `pending -> cancelled`. Cancellation is not failure.
- A completed row and all result/event/snapshot/terrain/frame payloads commit in
  one database transaction. Failed rows include the completion time and error.
- The shutdown timeout is a cooperative grace threshold, not permission to
  abandon an executor thread or close its database. A hard bounded stop would
  require a future move to killable worker processes.
- Background exceptions must be retrieved. Missing-row status updates must fail
  explicitly instead of silently discarding terminal state.
- Deleting an active run must cancel and await its task before removing the row.

### Production trace and failing proof

At the Phase 106 starting revision, the app normally called
`RunManager.shutdown()` before `Database.close()`, but lifespan cleanup was not
protected by `finally` and ignored settings passed to `create_app()`. API
fixtures closed the database without shutting down the manager. A submit-only
API test therefore passed while emitting an un-retrieved
`sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Cannot operate on a closed database`; batch
submission reproduced the same false green.

Forced `shutdown(timeout=0)` cancels only the asyncio wrapper around
`run_in_executor`. The worker thread continues, its shared cancellation flag is
removed, and the durable row remains `running` permanently. Cooperative
cancellation is also recorded as `failed`, and active deletion can remove a row
while its task still owns it.

### Verification

Verified on 2026-07-28. Real-router run and batch submissions followed by
immediate lifespan exit persist `cancelled` before SQLite closes. Controlled
workers prove that zero-grace and caller-cancelled shutdown both wait for the
actual executor thread. Normal, exceptional, and startup-failure lifespan paths
preserve resource ownership and exact factory settings.

Failure tests prove `failed`, completion time, exact error, terminal subscriber
notification even when a queue is full, and empty bookkeeping. Task callbacks
retrieve unpersistable background exceptions. Submission after shutdown is
rejected without a row, active deletion cancels and awaits, and missing-row
updates fail explicitly. Serialized SQLite write transactions prevent a failed
concurrent update from rolling back a valid run or batch update.

`Loaded`, `Enabled`, and simulation `Outcome` are N/A for resource ownership.
Production exercise and SQLite/API persistence are mandatory.

### Residual boundary

The thread-based executor cannot safely hard-kill a permanently blocked worker.
The grace timeout therefore warns and continues waiting; a bounded hard stop
would require process isolation. A fatal SQLite write failure is surfaced and
retrieved but cannot create a durable terminal row.

## REM-017 - Analysis tools can manufacture false-green results

### Reproduction

A one-iteration `run_sweep()` against
`data/scenarios/test_campaign/scenario.yaml` completed successfully while
logging that all ten scenario units were unknown. It returned zero destroyed
units for both sides instead of rejecting an invalid run.

### Cause

- `run_scenario_batch()` infers the loader root as
  `scenario_path.parent.parent`, which resolves to `data/scenarios` for the
  normal repository layout; `ScenarioLoader` requires `data`.
- The batch does not reject a scenario whose declared roster loads as zero
  units.
- `_extract_metrics()` returns `0.0` for unknown metrics.
- Existing sensitivity/comparison tests cover result structures and statistics,
  not real `run_sweep()`, `run_comparison()`, or production-loaded forces.

### Required proof

- Resolve or explicitly require the correct data root for every supported
  scenario layout.
- Reject missing declared units, empty invalid runs, and unsupported metric
  names.
- Exercise sensitivity and comparison through real `ScenarioLoader` and
  `SimulationEngine` runs.
- Show that a controlled override changes an intended metric and that invalid
  configuration cannot produce an authoritative-looking zero result.

Until REM-017 closes, `$calibrate`, `$compare`, and `$what-if` must preflight a
real loaded roster and stop rather than report unverified results.
